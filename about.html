                    <p>
                        Hello there, internet stranger!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My name is Jessica. I am a full stack software developer based in Montreal, Canada.
                        <br>
                        A little bit about me...
                    </p>
                    <h3>personal —</h3>
                    <p>
                        I love hiking adventures, discovering new music and anything food related. My latest obsession 
                        has been collecting cookbooks and planning trips to the local farmer's market to put 
                        together ungodly Sunday feasts. I am horrible at parallel parking (who isn't?) and I despise 
                        folding laundry. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>professional —</h3>
                    <p>
                        Back in 2018, while working towards my Bachelor's degree in Cognitive & Computer Sciences at McGill University, 
                        I began as an intern on a web-based software called LORIS. LORIS is a research platform specializing in the 
                        storage, processing and dissemination of large-scale behavioural and neuroimaging data. After graduating, I became a
                        full-time member of one of their private instance teams that catered to the <a class="inline-link" href="https://ccna-ccnv.ca/" target="_blank">
                            Canadian Consortium of Neurodegenration and Aging (CCNA)
                        </a>.
                        I quickly worked my way to becoming the technical lead of this project, and directed a team of 3 developers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2021, I felt that I needed a new challenge and moved onto a new project within LORIS' pool of private instances, 
                        <a class="inline-link" href="http://eegnet.org/" target="_blank">
                            EEGNet
                        </a>. As a new project on the roster, it was up to me 
                    </p>
